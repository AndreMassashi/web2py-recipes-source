chapter 2 Building your first applications

- Building your first applications
    - observations: listed as an example but it is not present as a section

- 01 Improving the scaffolding application
    2011-10-12
    - observations:
        - changed property name in db.py at line 24 from ...field to ...fields
        - had to change production value to False (the app was not finding the table auth_user when inserting a record)
        - removed pool_size from the call to DAL (see next item)
        - The app outputs debugging warnings (with pool_size set to 20):
            DEBUG_c: Exception (<type 'exceptions.Exception'>, OperationalError('Error creating function',))
        - After a while using the app (for example going to the register action), it raises an exception:

            Traceback (most recent call last):
            File "/home/alan/web2py-hg/gluon/restricted.py", line 194, in restricted
                exec ccode in environment
            File "/home/alan/web2py-hg/applications/improving_the_scaffolding_application/models/db.py", line 5, in <module>
                db = DAL(settings.db_uri,pool_size=20)
            File "/home/alan/web2py-hg/gluon/dal.py", line 4182, in __init__
                raise RuntimeError, "Failure to connect, tried %d times:\n%s" % (attempts, error)
            RuntimeError: Failure to connect, tried 5 times:
            Error creating function

            both issues seem to solve removing the pool_size argument in the call to DAL (if production is True)

- 02 Building a simple contacts application.
    2011-10-12
    - observations:
        - changed html end tag for markmin

- 03 Building a Reddit clone
    2011-10-12
    - observations:
        - Line 1961 default.py is not marked as the source py module (to copy the code to)
        - Line 2122 categories.html view is duplicated (should be removed)
        - changed template value news.url to news.link in news.html
        - news_comments.html vote ajax call is not accepted by the controller because it is not detected as POST request.
        - fixed property name http_method to request_method (ajax didn't work) in default.py vote() action

- 04 Building a Facebook Clone
    2011-10-12
    - observations:
        Â¿line 2198 file "models" is db.py?


- 05 Using crud.archive
    2011-10-12

- 07 Creating semi-static pages (flatpages)
    2011-10-13
    - observations:
        created the app and added a record counter at the end of the action setup_flatpage
        line 2705 modified indentation in if elif else structure for edit messages. file flatpages.py
        setup_flatpage creates en language records, so when client language is other pages are not found (should be warned in the book)

- 08 Adding your custom logo
    2011-10-13
    - observations:
        created the app and added a logo image (web2py logo_lb)

    2011-10-13

- 12 Using cookies to set the language
    2011-10-13
    - observations:
        two alternative layout.html files in source folder

- 13 Designing modular applications
    2011-10-13
    - observations:
        incomplete
        line 3224 default.py: display_changes is display_changed
        line 3221 onaccept event passes an object (named it form)
        still, the list of items created does not update automatically

    - observations: created the app

- 02 Creating a model from a csv file
    2011-10-13
    - observations:
        created the app
        the csvstudio.py script creates the table and adds lines to the model with the syntax:

        ### 0
        field1=value, field2=value, ...

        so the file needs cleanup before copying to the apps model.

    added code to the controller for user input (there was not controller or view code)

- 07 Accessing you database from multiple applications
    2011-10-13
    - observations:
        no app created
        connection string with postgres does not allow migrations? (both apps must have migration_enabled = False)
        the python script for metadata returns an empty list ([])

        created the .w2p and added code to the controller.
        The second part of the recipe is not working (no autocomplete list returned)

        In the book should say:

            Before the include "web2py_ajax.html" in layout.html place the following code:

            <script type="text/javascript">
            var app_loading_image = '{{ =IMG(_src=URL("static","images/loading.gif"), _alt="loading") }}';
            </script>

        Then, the jQuery sentence in ajax() must be changed to:

        IMPORTANT: CHECK LEGAL ISSUES ABOUT PUBLICATION OF FACEBOOK SCRIPT

        tested without fb api registration
        on login action the app shows a JSON text:

            {
            "error": {
                "message": "Error validating application.",

################################################################

notes
- a_b_c app name convention does not look good in the scaffolding app default titles

skipped apps:
chapter 02: modular, section 13 (incomplete)
replace :code_html (templates) with :code_web2py

Chapter 8 - 4 "...Multiuser..." has no code (except a line in 0.py)

routes recipes were tested with app installer only when needed (the most of them can be tested with web2py routes.py parameters)
Chapter 9 .w2p installers do not include the routes.py parameters wich can be copied from the source folders. (a workaround can be using local application routes files.)
